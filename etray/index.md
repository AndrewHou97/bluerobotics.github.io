# Installation

## Populating the main tray

1. Cut off the bullet connectors from the Afro ESCs.

2. Strip off about 4 mm of jacket from the ESC motor and power wires.

## Putting it All Together

1. Coat with silicone grease, then install the radial O-rings (size 238) on the O-ring flange.

2. Install the short standoffs into the O-ring flange finger tight plus 1/8 of a turn.

3. Set the etray rear tray on the short standoffs. Be sure to align the small slot on the rear tray with the standoffs that are aligned with the flange cap holes

4. Install two M3x8 screws into the two holes that are aligned with the narrow slots. Tighten the screws until they have slightly indented the rear tray

5. Install the two long standoffs into the two remaining holes finger tight plus 1/8 of a turn.

6. Place the power distribution side of the populated main tray into the slots of the rear tray.
