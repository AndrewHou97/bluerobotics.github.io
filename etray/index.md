# Introduction

The Etray is an exciting new way to mount your underwater electronics into a 4" watertight enclosure. We designed this tray to make installing and working on your electronics as convenient as possible. The Etray is designed to bolt to a 4" WTE O-ring
flange, so now when you want to access your electronics, simply remove the 4" tube from the O-ring flange.

</p>

## Putting the Tray Together

1. Install the four short standoffs in the four inch O-ring flange.

## Installing the Terminal Blocks

Some other components such as ESCs are easier to install without the terminal blocks on. It is also easier to attach wires to the Screw Terminal Block with 8 Circuits when the Eurostyle Terminal Block with 9 Circuits. 

1. Attach the jumpers to the Black Screw Terminal Block if necessary for your application.



2. Install the Black Screw Terminal Blocks onto the main tray.

3. Install the standoffs and White Eurostyle Terminal Block on top of the standoffs.

# Examples of Installed Electronics

We use the electronics tray on the _BlueROV2_ for both the Standard and Advanced Electronics Packages. The [_BlueROV2_ Assembly Instructions](http://docs.bluerobotics.com/brov2/assembly/#assembling-the-electronics-tray) show the process for attaching electronics to the Etray in detail. Here are some examples of what completed Etrays could look like:
