##Frame Assembly

The frame is the structure of the ROV and includes several laser-cut plastics pieces as well as metal hardware.

**Tools Needed:**

* 2.5mm Hex Key
* 3mm Hex Key

1. Remove the protective paper from all plastic parts.  

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/center-parts-1.jpg" class="img- responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

2. Next, we will loosely assemble the center structure before attaching it to the rest of the ROV. Start with the Center Panel, two Aluminum T-Slot Bars, four T-Slot Nuts, and four M5x12 Button-Head Socket Caps screws as shown above.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/t-slot-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

3. Insert the four screws into the Center Panel and lightly attached the T-slot Nuts as shown.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/center-asm-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

4. Slide the two Aluminum T-Slot Bars onto the T-Slot Nuts. Make sure the Center Panel is centered on both bars and gently tighten the screws.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/cradle-parts-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

5. Next we'll add the two Watertight Enclosure Cradles using four more nuts and screws. Insert the nut into the screw a few turns and then slide into the T-Slot bar. Then insert the plastic Cradle so that the screws fill the notches.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/center-asm-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

6. Gently tighten the screws to secure the Cradle as shown above.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/rear-mount-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

7. Next, install the Rear Thruster Mount with the same method. The tab on the Mount fits into the notch on the Center Panel to align the mount.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/center-w-straps-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

8. Last, insert the straps that will hold the Watertight Enclosure and cut two pieces of Rubber Edge Strip to fit on the curved surface of the cradle. You can secure the strips with hot glue if desired, but it is not necessary.

	<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/bluerov/frame-standoffs-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />

9. Using twelve M4x10 Button-Head Socket Cap Screws, attach the six Round Aluminum Standoffs between the two Side Panels. The Blue Robotics logo should face outward on each panel.  

10. Using four M5x12 Button-Head Socket Cap Screws, attach the center panel assembly to the rest of the frame. Use a measuring device to ensure that the Center Panel is centered between the two Side Panels. If not, you can loosen the screws and adjust it.  

11. That's it! The frame is complete.

##Watertight Enclosure Assembly

Please see the [Watertight Enclosure Assembly Tutorial](/watertight-enclosures/) for detailed instructions on how to assemble the Watertight Enclosure. Once the enclosure is assembled, do the following:

1. We need the enclosure in place to measure the necessary length of each thruster cable. Attach the enclosure to the frame using the two velcro straps.  

2. The enclosure can be moved forward and backward to adjust center of gravity and center of buoyancy of the vehicle. 

##Thruster Installation

1. First, we'll change the propellers on two thrusters so that we have counter-rotating pairs. Follow the instructions on the [Thruster Manual](/thrusters/) to do so.  

2. Next, we'll attached the size thrusters to the frame using twenty-four M3x10 Button-Head Socket Cap screws. See the pictures for proper orientation or refer to the following:
  * The two front thrusters should be counter-rotating and face upwards
  * The rear thruster faces upwards
  * The two middle thrusters face forward and should be counter-rotating
  * The bottom thrusters faces with the front pointing towards the left side of the ROV

3. Now that the thrusters are mounted, we will measure the length necessary for each cable. Route the cables carefully and insert them into the six lower holes in the rear end-cap of the ROV. Leaving a few inches of slack, mark each cable where it enters the enclosure.

4. Cut each cable to a length about 4" longer than the mark that was just made.

5. Follow the [Cable Stripping Tutorial](/tutorials/cable-stripping/) to remove 4" of cable jacket from each cable.

6. Next, follow the [Cable Penetrator Tutorial](/tutorials/cable-penetrator/) to install the cable penetrator bolt on each cable. Allow time for the sealant to dry on each penetrator before installation on the end cap.

7. Install each of the cable penetrators on the end cap by first applying silicon grease to each o-ring and sliding onto the penetrator bolt. Pass the penetrator through the end-cap and secure with the nut. A firm hand-tightness is adequate.
