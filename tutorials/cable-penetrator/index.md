#Introduction

Our cable penetrators make waterproof, high-pressure seals to pass the thruster cables into a water-tight enclosure. Each set includes a bolt, nut, and O-ring. We offer cable penetrators with a hole for the thruster cable and also with no hole.

#Installation

This tutorial should help make the Cable Penetrator Installation simple!

**Safety**

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with tools, always use caution. This tutorial is provided as guidance and should be followed at your own risk.

**Tools You Need**

* Super Glue
* [Marine Epoxy](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/tools/loctite-marine-epoxy/)
* Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning

##Step 1: Stripping the Jacket

To strip the wire jacket, please follow the [Cable Jacket Stripping Tutorial](/tutorials/cable-stripping/).

##Step 2: Cleaning Surfaces

Start by cleaning all surfaces that will be in contact with epoxy with isopropyl alcohol. This will ensure a good bond. Clean the inside of the penetrator and the end of the cable. Let it dry for a few minutes before continuing.

##Step 3: Attaching the Penetrator

Twist the conductors so they will slide through the penetrator.

Apply a small amount of super glue to the edge of the cable jacket. Optionally, you can apply "CA kicker" inside the penetrator so that the glue will dry quickly.

Insert the cable into the penetrator, allowing the super glue to set.  

##Step 4: Sealing the Penetrator

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-4.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Mix the epoxy and fill the syringe.

<img src="/assets/images/tutorials/cable-penetrator/step-6.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:600px" />
Fill the penetrator hole with the epoxy. Move the cable from side to side within the hole to ensure the epoxy is filling any gaps. Use a vice or other method to hold the penetrator upright while the epoxy cures.

After the epoxy dries, apply the same method to the other side of the penetrator. 

##Step 5: Installation

#Notes

* If using a cable with smaller diameter, you can add layers of heat shrink tubing to increase diameter for a snug fit in the cable penetrator.
