#Introduction

This tutorial should help make the Cable Penetrator Installation simple!

##Safety

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with tools, always use caution. This tutorial is provided as guidance and should be followed at your own risk.

##Tools You Need

* Super Glue
* [Marine Epoxy](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/tools/loctite-marine-epoxy/)
* Isopropyl alcohol for cleaning

#Instructions

##Step 1: Stripping the Jacket

To strip the wire jacket, please follow the [Cable Jacket Stripping Tutorial](/tutorials/cable-stripping/).

##Step 2: Cleaning Surfaces

Start by cleaning all surfaces that will be in contact with epoxy with isopropyl alcohol. This will ensure a good bond. Clean the inside of the penetrator and the end of the cable. Let it dry for a few minutes before continuing.

##Step 3: Attaching the Penetrator

Insert the cable into the penetrator, allowing the super glue to set.  

##Step 4: Sealing the Penetrator

Fill the penetrator hole with the epoxy. Move the cable from side to side within the hole to ensure the epoxy is filling any gaps. Use a vice or other method to hold the penetrator upright while the epoxy cures.

After the epoxy dries, apply the same method to the other side of the penetrator. 

##Step 5: Installation

To be completed.

#Notes

* If using a cable with smaller diameter, you can add layers of heat shrink tubing to increase diameter for a snug fit in the cable penetrator.
