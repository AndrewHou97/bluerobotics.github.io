# Comparison

The *Basic ESC* and *BlueESC* are both electronic speed controllers that can be used with the T100 and T200 Thrusters. They are both very similar designs with a few key differences.

The *Basic ESC* is a standard hobby ESC that has been reprogrammed with custom firmware to enable both forward *and* reverse rotation, important for a thruster. It is an electronic PCB with power, motor, and signal wires. It must be mounted in a dry location away from the thruster.

The *BlueESC* is a custom designed ESC from Blue Robotics, based on the Basic ESC, but designed to be waterproof, water-cooled, and integrated directly into the thrusters. It is waterproofed by sealing with potting compound in an aluminum heat-sinking enclosure. The BlueESC has two cables (power cable and signal cable) that must be connected to a battery and signal source.

In addition to standard PWM signals, the BlueESC can be controlled through I<sup>2</sup>C signals and can also send RPM, voltage, current, and temperature status messages.

## When to Use the Basic ESC

* When you already have a watertight enclosure in which to mount the ESCs
* When it is fine to use standard PWM control signals
* When you want to be able to replace a damaged ESC easily
* When you want to minimize cost

## When to Use the BlueESC

* When you don't have a watertight enclosure or don't have space for an ESC
* When you can't manage the heat generated by an ESC
* When you want RPM, voltage, current, and temperature status from the ESC (via I<sup>2</sup>C)
