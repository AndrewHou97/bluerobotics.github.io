## Changing the Propellers

[brief explanation of why we the propellers are the way that they are]

1. Remove 3 thrusters from their tubes.

	[picture of three thrusters removed from their tubes]
	
2. Switch the propellers from the clockwise thrusters that come installed to the counter-clockwise thrusters that come along with the thrusters. Please refer to our [Changing the Propeller Tutorial](/tutorials/changing-the-propeller) for detailed instructions.

3. The next few steps will be easier if you keep the clockwise and counter-clockwise thrusters seperated, but for reference the picture below shows clockwise and counter-clockwise propellers installed on thrusters.

	[annotated picture with cw and ccw thrusters]

##Installing the Penetrators

If you install the penetrators as shown in the diagram below, it will keep everything neat, organized and logical.

[annotated picture of what penetrator goes where on an as shipped end cap]

1. Find the bag with 2 black penetrator nuts, 7 red penetrator nuts and 9 size 013 O-rings.

	[picure of the bag]
	
2. Remove 8 of the O-rings and apply Silicone grease to them.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/grease-o-ring.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

3. Install the O-rings onto all of the thruster penetrators, the lumen penetrator, and the tether penetrator.

	[picture of installed o-ring]
	
4. Install the penetrators to the end cap in the order shown below. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrenches to tighten them an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can't loosen them with your fingers, they are tight enough. 

	- Thruster 1 (CCW propeller)
	- Thruster 5 (CCW propeller)
	- Thruster 3 (CW propeller)
	- Lumen 
	- Thruster 4 (CW propeller)
	- Thruster 6 (CW propeller)
	- Thruster 2 (CCW propeller)
	- Tether
	
## Installing the End Cap

1. Retrieve the size [size here] O-ring, the 6 M3x12 screws, and the 2 clips that you removed earlier

	[picture of the o-ring, screws, and clips]
	
2. Clean the O-ring and make sure that it is free of any debris or damage.

	[picture of a clean O-ring]

3. Apply Silicone grease to the O-ring.

4. Install O-ring back onto the flange seal

	[picture of the O-ring back in the flange seal]
	
5. Install the end cap onto the O-ring. Pay close attention to the orientation. Do not fully tighten any screws fully when first installing them; it may cause the O-ring to slip out of its groove.

	[picture or cad model of the end cap back on the flange seal]
	
## Installing the Wires from the Penetrators

Here is a diagram showing where all of the wires from the penetrators go. The following steps will show an order of operations that makes it easy to install the wires and show pictures of what they look like when installed.

1. Connect the battery power wires to the power terminal block

	[clear picture of a battery power wire attached]

2. Connect the Lumen power wires to the power terminal block

	[clear picture a lumen power wire attached]

3. Connect the Bar30 cable to the I<sup>2</sup>C port on the PixHawk

	<img src="/brov2/cad/i2c-installed.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

4. Connect the motor wires to the motor wire terminal block.

	[show them connected; mention the bagawa convention]

5. Connect the tether wires to the tether board.

	[standard]
	
	[advanced]
	
## Electronics Tray Cable Management

Occasionally, you may want to open and close the electronics enclosure, and it is very helpful to have the wires tidy so that they do not get caught up with the acrylic tube. We recommend something like this.

	[gotta see if the new trays facilitate having step by step wiring instrustions]

## Mounting the Electronics Enclosure onto the Frame

1. Reinstall tube with dome over the electronics tray.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/installed-etray-empty-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

2. Apply one or two drops of threadlocker to the 4 M3x16 screws in the bag with only 4 M3x16 screws.

3. Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the cradles. It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the cradles. This allows to cradles to rotate so you can find the cradle hole easily.

	[cad exploded view]

	<img src="/brov2/cad/installed-etray-empty-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />
	
## Mounting the Thrusters to the Frame

Here is a diagram of where the thrusters go. The order of installation does matter here. You cannot get the front thrusters on if the rear ones were installed first.

Grab the bag with 24 M3x16 screws. These screws do not require threadlocker, the frame and the small head size serve keep them from backing out.

1. Install thrusters 1 and 2. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly. It is physically possible to keep turning the screw at this point, but it isn't necessary.

	[close up picture of a screw slightly indenting the frame]
	
	[picture of thrusters 1 and 2 installed]
	
2. Install thrusters 5 and 6. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

3. Install thrusters 3 and 4. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

## Mounting the Lights

Loop 1 size 133 O-ring from the bag that had the Lumen Mounts and screws around each Lumen Mount and Lumen as shown below.

<img src="/lumen/cad/lumen-tutorial-14.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />	

## Mounting the Tether to the Frame

The tether needs to be firmly mounted to the frame to prevent the tether penetrator from being loosened. To do this start by grabbing the bag with 5 large zip ties and a thimble.

[picture of the bag]

1. Grab the tether between around 12 inches away from the tether penetrator.

2. Loop the tether around the plastic thimble.

	[picture of the tether looping]
	
3. Firmly attach 3 of the zip ties, alternating directions they are installed, around the tether right where it enters and exits the thimble.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-a1.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />	
	
4. Attach the thimble to the rear panel as shown

	[picture of the thimble attached to the rear panel with no fairings]
	
## Finishing the Battery Enclosure

1. Find the bag that had the penetrator nuts and O-rings in it and grab the remaining black nut and O-ring.

	[picture of the bag]
	
2. Apply Silicone grease to the O-ring.

3. Install the O-ring onto the battery power cable penetrator.

	[picture showing it installed]
	
4. Install the battery power cable penetrator into the opening in the battery end cap.

	[picture of it installed]
	
5. Install the XT90 to bullet connector adaptor to the battery power wire. 

	[picture of the adaptor installed]
	
## Thruster and Lumen Cable Management

To clean up the thruster and lumen wires, you will need the bag of 30 zip ties and your scissors/wire cutters.

[bottom view of the frame point out cable routing points]

[picture of an example of cleaned up wires]

[should formalize my process and write it down as the instructions]

## Installing the Fairings and Buoyancy

The buoyancy comes preinstalled in the fairings, but make sure it is still in all of the fairings prior to installing the fairings. To install the fairings, you will need the 16 #4 3/4" long self tapping screws and the included #1 phillips head screwdriver.

1. Remove the Lumens from their mount.

	[picture showing them hanging]

2. Install the screws through the center panels and into the fairings.

	[diagram of which screws to use]
	
	[picture of someone installing them]
	
3. Reinstall the Lumens.
