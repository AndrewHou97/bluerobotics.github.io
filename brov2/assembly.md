## Electronics Tray Cable Management

Occasionally, you may want to open and close the electronics enclosure, and it is very helpful to have the wires tidy so that they do not get caught up with the acrylic tube. We recommend something like this.

	[gotta see if the new trays facilitate having step by step wiring instrustions]

## Mounting the Electronics Enclosure onto the Frame

1. Reinstall tube with dome over the electronics tray.

	<img src="/brov2/cad/installed-etray-empty-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

2. Apply one or two drops of threadlocker to the 4 M3x16 screws in the bag with only 4 M3x16 screws.

3. Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the cradles. It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the cradles. This allows to cradles to rotate so you can find the cradle hole easily.

## Mounting the Thrusters to the Frame

To mount the thrusters to the frame, you need the following tools and items:

- 2.5 mm allen key driver
- 6 T200 thrusters
- Bag with 24 M3x16 screws
- The ROV frame

Here is a diagram of where the thrusters go. The order of installation does matter here. You cannot get the front thrusters on if the rear ones were installed first.

<img src="http://ardusub.com/images/vectored-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

1. Install thrusters 1 and 2. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly. It is physically possible to keep turning the screw at this point, but it isn't necessary.

	[close up picture of a screw slightly indenting the frame]
	
	[picture of thrusters 1 and 2 installed]
	
2. Install thrusters 5 and 6. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

3. Install thrusters 3 and 4. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

## Mounting the Lights

To install the Lumen mounts you will need the following tools and items:

- The bag with the Lumen mounts, O-rings, and 4 M3x12 socket head cap screws (included with ROV)
- 2.5mm hex driver (included with ROV)
- 2 side panels

Loop 1 size 133 O-ring from the bag that had the Lumen Mounts and screws around each Lumen Mount and Lumen as shown below.

## Mounting the Tether to the Frame

The tether needs to be firmly mounted to the frame to prevent the tether penetrator from being loosened. To do this, you will need the following tools and items:

- Bag with thimble and 5 large zip ties
- Tether 
- ROV frame

1. Grab the tether between around 12 inches away from the tether penetrator.

2. Loop the tether around the plastic thimble.

	[picture of the tether looping]
	
3. Firmly attach 3 of the zip ties, alternating directions they are installed, around the tether right where it enters and exits the thimble.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-a1.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />	
	
4. Attach the thimble to the rear panel as shown

	[picture of the thimble attached to the rear panel with no fairings]
	
## Finishing the Battery Enclosure

To finish installing the battery enclosure you need the following tools and items:

- The bag with one black penetrator nut and one O-ring left in it
- The 4 hole 3 inch enclosure end cap
- 2 16 mm wrenches
- XT90 to 3.5 mm bullet connector adapter
 
1. Find the bag that had the penetrator nuts and O-rings in it and grab the remaining black nut and O-ring.
	
2. Apply Silicone grease to the O-ring.

3. Install the O-ring onto the battery power cable penetrator.

	[picture showing it installed]
	
4. Install the battery power cable penetrator into the opening in the battery end cap.

	[picture of it installed]
	
5. Install the XT90 to bullet connector adapter to the battery power wire.

## Installing the Fairings and Buoyancy

The buoyancy comes preinstalled in the fairings, but make sure it is still in all of the fairings prior to installing the fairings. To install the fairings, you will need the following items:

- 4 Fairings with buoyancy installed (included with the ROV)
- Bag with 16 self tapping screws (included with the ROV)
- \#1 phillips head screwdriver (included with the ROV)

1. Remove the Lumens from their mount.

	[picture showing them hanging]

2. Install the screws through the center panels and into the fairings.
	
	[picture of someone installing them]
	
3. Reinstall the Lumens.
