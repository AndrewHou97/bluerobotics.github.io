# Introduction

The **BlueROV** is an unassembled ROV kit with frame, watertight enclosure, thrusters, and speed controllers. Hardware/software experience required. It uses six thrusters to provide five-degree-of-freedom control allowing you to point the ROV in almost any orientation to film anything, grab anything with a simple robot arm, and have a lot of fun! 

## Safety 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with electricity, especially in water, always practice caution. Always ensure that connections are secure and watertight. Keep your body away from spinning motors and propellers.

# Tools Needed

* 2 - 16mm Open Ended Wrenches 
* Wire Cutters or Scissors (for cutting zip ties)
* Phillips Head Screw Driver
* 2mm Flat Head Screw Driver
* Thread locker (we recommend loctite 243)

<img src="cad/installed-etray-empty-frame.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

2. Install a 013 O-ring on the power wire penetrator, then install it onto the open spot on the battery enclosure end cap.

3. Install counter-clockwise propellers to thrusters 1, 2, and 5. Follow the [changing the propeller tutorial](http://docs.bluerobotics.com/tutorials/changing-the-propeller/)

<img src="cad/end-cap-with-penetrators.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

4. Install thrusters 1 and 2. Tighten screws until they indent the frame slightly. 

5. Install thrusters 5 and 6. Tighten the screws until they indent the frame slightly.

6. Install thrusters 3 and 4. Tighten the screws until they indent the frame slightly.

7. Use the provided zip ties and the holes in the center panels to clean up the wiring as shown. The goal is to make sure that there are no loose wires to get caught while opening and closing the enclosure.

<img src="cad/lumen-installed-close.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

8. Install the Lumens into the Lumen mount using the 133 O-ring that is in the same bag that the Lumen mount was in.

9. Install the tether into the thimble. See the [strain relief section of the tether tutorial](http://docs.bluerobotics.com/fathom/#strain-relief) for more details.

10. Attach the tether thimble to the frame as shown.

11. Check that the buoyancy foam is still installed in the fairing.

<img src="cad/buoyancy-in-fairing.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

12. Attach the fairings to the frame using the 3/4 inch long #4 self tapping screws.

13. Attach the XT-90 to 5mm bullet connector to the 5mm bullet connectors on the power cable on the battery enclosure side.

14. Vacuum test your electronics and battery enclosures.

15. Attach your battery and that's it!

## Installing Ballast Weights

<img src="cad/ballast-installed-close.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

We recommend leaving the BlueROV2 slightly positively buoyant so that if your battery dies while you are diving, the ROV will help you when you are pulling it back in. 
The BlueROV2 is slightly tail heavy, so we recommend starting with more of the ballast in the front.
