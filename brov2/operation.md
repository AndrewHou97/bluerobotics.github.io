# Introduction

The **BlueROV** is an unassembled ROV kit with frame, watertight enclosure, thrusters, and speed controllers. Hardware/software experience required. It uses six thrusters to provide five-degree-of-freedom control allowing you to point the ROV in almost any orientation to film anything, grab anything with a simple robot arm, and have a lot of fun! 

## Safety 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with electricity, especially in water, always practice caution. Always ensure that connections are secure and watertight. Keep your body away from spinning motors and propellers.
