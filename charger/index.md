# Introduction

The <em>Lithium Battery Charger</em> is a high power 300W AC/DC balance charger, that will work with most lithium chemistries (Li-Po/Li-Ion/Li-Fe), as well as NiCd/NiMH and lead batteries. With built in balancing and discharge capability, your batteries can safely be kept in top condition for maximum performance and lifespan! A maximum 20A charge current means you can fully charge our <a href="http://bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/batteries/battery-li-4s-18ah-r1/"><em>Lithium-ion Battery (14.8V, 18Ah)</em> </a> in 1-2 hours at the recommended 10A charge rate.

# Safety

Although they are safe enough to be used in everyday devices (phones, laptops. etc.) batteries have a high energy density and must be treated with care to ensure proper safe operation and a long lifecycle. When using the charger, be sure to follow proper procedures, and always read the battery manual before charging a new battery.

* Do not leave unattended while charging
* Do not exceed the battery maximum charge or discharge rate
* Do not cover cooling fans or use on a soft surface

# Charging

To charge any supported battery, the proper settings must first be selected. The recommended settings specific to our <a href="http://bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/batteries/battery-li-4s-18ah-r1/"><em>Lithium-ion Battery (14.8V, 18Ah)</em> </a> are listed as an example.

* Plug battery into charger, as well as balance plug if applicable
* Select battery type/chemistry (Lithium Battery)
* Select charge cycle type (Lipo Balance Charge)
* Select charge current (10A recommended)
* Press and hold "Start" to begin charge cycle

Make sure to keep battery and charger away from flammable materials and monitor the battery as it charges, discontinue charging if it becomes hot or changes in appearance.

Refer to the included manual for more details about charging cycles and other charger functions.
