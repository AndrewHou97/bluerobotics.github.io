# Assembly and Installation

## BlueROV2 Partial Disassembly

To partially disassemble your BlueROV2, you will need the following tools:

- 1 x 2.5 mm hex driver
- 1x #1 Phillips head screwdriver
- 1x Wire cutters or scissors
- 1x Penetrator wrench
- Optional: 1x Roll of masking tape and marker


1.	To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3” enclosure and place to the side.

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-disassembly-step-1.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

2.	Remove the fairings and buoyancy blocks by removing the self-tapping screws that hold the fairings to the frame.

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-3.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

3.	Optional: In order to ensure thruster mounting is not mixed up, it is recommended to apply short strips of masking tape to the outside of the thruster ducts and labeling them 5,6,7 and 8 respectively according to the thruster diagrams.

    - Thruster 5 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut.
    - Thruster 6 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut.
    - Thruster 7 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut.
    - Thruster 8 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut.

6.	Remove the 4” Electronics enclosure from the ROV by removing the M3x16 screws that mount the enclosure to the ROV cradle.
<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

7. remove vent cap and Enclosure cylinder

7.	Remove the Aluminum End Cap with 14 Holes by removing the six M3x12 screws using the M2.5 hex driver. Place the M3x12 screws, clips (small L-shaped parts), and face seal O-ring in a safe place.

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-7.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

8.	Remove the two blank penetrators as pictured from the 4” End Cap with the penetrator wrench that came with the BlueROV2 kit.

## Install New Thrusters

To Install the new thrusters, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	1 x T200 with counter-clockwise propeller
-	1 x T200 with clockwise propeller
-	1 x Bag with 8 M3x12 screws
-	8 x M3x12 screws you had set aside from removing Thrusters 5 and 6
-	1 x Silicone Grease – 10g Tube
-	1 x Threadlocker
-	1 x Penetrator wrench
-	1 x 2.5 mm hex driver

1.	Install Thrusters 7 and 8 into the respective empty penetrator holes. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrench to tighten them an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can’t loosen them with your fingers, they are tight enough.

    - Thruster 7 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut.
    - Thruster 8 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut.

2.	Reinstall the 4” Aluminum End Cap with the following steps:

    - Clean the O-ring and make sure that it is free of any debris or damage.

    - Clean the O-Ring Flange (4” Series) and make sure that the O-ring groove is free of any debris or damage.

    - Apply Silicone grease to the O-ring.

    - Install face seal O-ring onto the O-Ring Flange (4” Series).

    - Apply one drop of threadlocker to each of the M3x12 screws. Roll the screws around on a paper towel to evenly spread the threadlocker and to remove excess threadlocker.

    - Install Aluminum End Cap with 14 Holes with all Cable Penetrators and Blank Penetrators installed onto the O-Ring Flange (4” Series). Do not fully tighten any screws when first installing them; it may cause the O-ring to slip out of its groove. The end cap’s orientation when installed should match the image below. Make sure that the clips are oriented correctly. One should be just right of the Thruster 3 penetrator, and the other should be just left of the Thruster 4 penetrator.

3.	Install thrusters 5, 6, 7 and 8, using the M3x12 screws on the outside of the side panels. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

## Install New Electronics

To install the new electronics, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	2 x Basic ESC
-	2 x 3 Pole Euro Terminal Block
-	1 x Small (~2 mm) flat head screw driver
-	1 x Large (~#2) Phillips head screw driver
1.	Slide the new 3 pole Euro terminal blocks into their mounting location on top of the 9 pole Euro terminal blocks and one of the poles is between the aluminum standoff.

2.	Connect the motor power wires from the thrusters 7 and 8 to the motor terminal blocks as shown, using your 2 mm flat head screw driver.

3.	Connect the motor power wires from the new ESCs to the motor terminal blocks as shown, using your 2 mm flat head screw driver.

4.	Plug ESC Signal Wires into Pixhawk with the following steps:

    - Unplug the Lumen light signal wire from the Pixhawk Channel 7 port and replug it into Aux Channel 1 with the yellow wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk. 
    - Unplug the camera tilt servo from Pixhawk Channel 8 and replug it into Aux Channel 2 with the yellow signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.
    - Plug the servo signal wire for Thruster 7 into Channel 7 on the Pixhawk with the white signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.
    - Plug the servo signal wire for Thruster 8 into Channel 8 on the Pixhawk with the white signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.

5.	Connect the ESC Power Wires into open screw terminals on the respective positive and negative terminal blocks.

## Install New Thruster Guards

To install the new thruster guards, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	1 Bag of 12 M4x16mm screws
-	1 Bag of #4x3/8” Thread forming screws
-	8 x Heavy Guard Mounting Brackets
-	2 x Heavy Guards
-	1x #1 Phillips head screwdriver


Install the thruster guards using the M4x16 screws, #4x3/8” screws and aluminum mounting brackets. The thruster guards only install in one direction with the shorter leading edge of the guard oriented towards the front end of the vehicle.

## Reassemble BlueROV2

To reassemble your BlueROV2, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	4 x M3x16 screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	16 x Fairing screws that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	4 x Fairings with buoyancy installed that were placed off to the side during disassembly
-	1 x Silicone Grease – 10g Tube
-	1 x Threadlocker
-	1 x 2.5 mm hex driver
-	1x #1 Phillips head screwdriver


1.	Reinstall 4” Watertight Enclosure onto ROV with the following steps:

    - Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4” Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray then install the Watertight Enclosure (4” Series) with installed Dome End Cap to the O-Ring Flange (4” Series).

    - Apply one drop of threadlocker to each of the four M3x16 screws. Roll the screws around on a paper towel to evenly spread the threadlocker and to remove excess threadlocker.

    - Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). This allows to clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series) easily.

## Cable Management

To clean up the thruster and lumen wires, you will need the bag of 30 zip ties and your scissors/wire cutters.

The primary goal of Thruster and Lumen cable management is to prevent the wires from getting cut by the propellers. Make sure to check that no wire can reach a propeller after you have finished routing the cables. Below are some examples of what the cable routing should look like.

## Install New Buoyancy Blocks and Fairings

To install the new buoyancy blocks and fairings, you will need the following parts and tools:

-	2 x Heavy additional buoyancy blocks
-	2 x Heavy fairings
-	1 x Bag of 4 fairing screws
-	1x #1 Phillips head screwdriver

1.	 Reinstall Original Fairing Blocks onto ROV by installing the screws through the center panels and into the fairings.

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-3.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

2.	Place the new round Heavy buoyancy blocks into the open space where Thrusters 5 and 6 used to be. Ensure the flat sides of the blocks are parallel to the sides of the ROV.

3.	Place the new plastic Heavy fairings on top of the buoyancy blocks and secure them to the old fairing blocks using the included self-tapping fairing screws.
