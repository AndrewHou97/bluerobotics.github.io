# Introduction

The <em>BlueROV2 Heavy Retrofit Kit</em> is a modular frame extension for the BlueROV2 with which includes two additional thrusters, ESCs, buoyancy foam and fairings. The Heavy Retrofit Kit provides some powerful new capabilities: six degree-of-freedom control, active roll and pitch stability, and additional lifting capability.

# Usage

Assemble according to the below steps, and the Heavy Retrofit Kit will allow you to have full six degree-of-freedom control, active roll and pitch stability, and additional lifting capability.


# Assembly and Installation

## Step 1: Remove Battery from BlueROV2

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-1.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

To ensure your ROV is completely powered off, please remove the battery completely from the 3” enclosure and place to the side.

## Step 2: Remove Electronics Enclosure from BlueROV2 Cradle

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Remove the 4” Electronics enclosure from the ROV by removing the M3x16 screws that mount the enclosure to the ROV cradle.

## Step 3: Remove Fairings and Buoyancy Blocks

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-3.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Remove the fairings and buoyancy blocks by removing the self-tapping screws that hold the fairings to the frame.

## Step 4: Optional, but highly recommended: Number Thrusters with Masking Tape

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-4-A.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />
<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-4-B.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

In order to ensure thruster mounting is not mixed up, it is recommended to apply short strips of masking tape to the outside of the thruster ducts and labeling them 5,6,7 and 8 respectively according to the thruster diagrams.

1.	Thruster 5 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut
2.	Thruster 6 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut
3.	Thruster 7 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut
4.	Thruster 8 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut.

## Step 5: Unmount Thrusters 5 and 6 

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-5.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Remove the M3x12 screws holding Thrusters 5 and 6 to the side panels and place the screws to the side.

## Step 6: Remove Zipties 

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-6.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Cut and remove any zipties holding the motor wires for Thrusters 5 and 6 to the frame. 

## Step 7: Remove 4” Endcap

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-7.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

Remove the Aluminum End Cap with 14 Holes by removing the six M3x12 screws using the M2.5 hex driver. Place the M3x12 screws, clips (small L-shaped parts), and face seal O-ring in a safe place.

## Step 8: Remove Two Blank Penetrators

Remove the two blank penetrators as pictured from the 4” End Cap with the penetrator wrench that came with the BlueROV2 kit.

## Step 9: Install Thrusters 7 and 8 into Empty Penetrator Holes

Install Thrusters 7 and 8 into the respective empty penetrator holes. Tighten to finger tight, then use the provided wrench to tighten them an additional ~1/16 of a turn. If you can’t loosen them with your fingers, they are tight enough.

1.	Thruster 7 (CW propeller) with red penetrator nut
2.	Thruster 8 (CCW propeller) with red penetrator nut.

## Step 10: Reinstall 4” Endcap

1.	Clean the O-ring and make sure that it is free of any debris or damage.

2.	Clean the O-Ring Flange (4” Series) and make sure that the O-ring groove is free of any debris or damage.

3.	Apply Silicone grease to the O-ring.

4.	Install face seal O-ring onto the O-Ring Flange (4” Series).

5.	Apply one drop of threadlocker to each of the M3x12 screws. Roll the screws around on a paper towel to evenly spread the threadlocker and to remove excess threadlocker.

6.	Install Aluminum End Cap with 14 Holes with all Cable Penetrators and Blank Penetrators installed onto the O-Ring Flange (4” Series). Do not fully tighten any screws when first installing them; it may cause the O-ring to slip out of its groove. The end cap’s orientation when installed should match the image below. Make sure that the clips are oriented correctly. One should be just right of the Thruster 3 penetrator, and the other should be just left of the Thruster 4 penetrator.

## Step 11: Install Thrusters 5,6,7 and 8 onto Frame

Install thrusters 5, 6, 7 and 8, using the M3x12 screws on the outside of the side panels. Tighten the screws so that they indent the frame slightly.

## Step 12: Install Port and Starboard Thruster Guards

Install the thruster guards using the M4x16 screws, #4x3/8” screws and aluminum mounting brackets. The thruster guards only install in one direction with the shorter leading edge of the guard oriented towards the front end of the vehicle.

## Step 13: Install New Euro Terminal Blocks

Slide the new 3 pole Euro terminal blocks into their mounting location on top of the 9 pole Euro terminal blocks and one of the poles is between the aluminum standoff.

## Step 14: Attach Thruster Wires to New Euro Terminal Blocks

Connect the motor power wires from the thrusters 7 and 8 to the motor terminal blocks as shown, using your 2.5 or 3 mm flat head screw driver.

## Step 15: Attach ESC Wires to New Euro Terminal Block

Connect the motor power wires from the new ESCs to the motor terminal blocks as shown, using your 2.5 or 3 mm flat head screw driver.

## Step 16: Plug ESC Signal Wires into Pixhawk

1.	Unplug the Lumen light signal wire from the Pixhawk Channel 7 port and replug it into Aux Channel 1 with the yellow wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk. 
2.	Unplug the camera tilt servo from Pixhawk Channel 8 and replug it into Aux Channel 2 with the yellow signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.
3.	Plug the servo signal wire for Thruster 7 into Channel 7 on the Pixhawk with the white signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.
4.	Plug the servo signal wire for Thruster 8 into Channel 8 on the Pixhawk with the white signal wire oriented toward the bottom of the Pixhawk.

## Step 17: Connect ESC Power Wires into Power Terminal Block

Connect the ESC Power Wires into open screw terminals on the respective positive and negative terminal blocks.

## Step 18: Reinstall 4” Watertight Enclosure onto ROV

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-2.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

1.	Apply silicone grease to the two radial O-rings on the O-Ring Flange (4” Series) that is attached to the Electronics Tray then install the Watertight Enclosure (4” Series) with installed Dome End Cap to the O-Ring Flange (4” Series).

2.	Apply one drop of threadlocker to each of the four M3x16 screws. Roll the screws around on a paper towel to evenly spread the threadlocker and to remove excess threadlocker.

3.	Mount the Electronics Enclosure to the frame using the M3x16 screws so that the dome is on the same side as the front center panels (the center panels without the 3 large holes). Install the M3x16 screws through the clips and into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). It is easier to install these screws if the clips are not fully tightened until all screws are through the clips and threading into the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series). This allows to clips to rotate so you can find the threaded hole in the Enclosure Cradle (4” Series) easily.

## Step 19: Reinstall Original Fairing Blocks onto ROV

<img src="/brov2-heavy/cad/heavy-step-3.PNG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Install the screws through the center panels and into the fairings.

## Step 20: Place new Buoyancy Blocks onto Frame

Place the new round Heavy buoyancy blocks into the open space where Thrusters 5 and 6 used to be. Ensure the flat sides of the blocks are parallel to the sides of the ROV.

## Step 21: Install New Middle Fairing Covers

Place the new plastic Heavy fairings on top of the buoyancy blocks and secure them to the old fairing blocks using the included self-tapping fairing screws.

## Step 22: Cable Management

To clean up the thruster and lumen wires, you will need the bag of 30 zip ties and your scissors/wire cutters.

The primary goal of Thruster and Lumen cable management is to prevent the wires from getting cut by the propellers. Make sure to check that no wire can reach a propeller after you have finished routing the cables. Below are some examples of what the cable routing should look like.
