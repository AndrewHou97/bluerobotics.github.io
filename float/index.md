#Introduction

Blue Robotics offers subsea buoyancy foam for use on ROVs, AUVs, and other marine vehicles. The foam is water and pressure resistant. It's also machinable, glueable, and paintable so that you can make just about any shape imaginable.

<!--##Important Notes-->

<!--<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>
Always inspect the o-rings before inserting onto the tube. Any dust, hair, or other particles can cause a leak.-->

<!--<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw fa-2x blue"></i>
A slight clicking noise is normal, especially when operated dry. It is caused by slight movement of the shaft in the plastic bearings.-->

#Battery Selection

The T100 thruster can be powered off of any 6 – 16V power source, and the T200 off of 6 – 20V. This can be an AC power supply, lead acid battery such as from a car,  nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery, or a lithium polymer (LiPo) battery. LiPo batteries are particularly light and energy dense while offering high performance with low voltage drop under load, making them the recommended choice for on board ROV power.

LiPo battery cells come in different voltages, in which each cell is nominally 3.7V.  However, when fully charged a LiPo battery cell rests at 4.2V, and this must be taken into account when determining if your electronics will be able to handle your battery.
