# Introduction

The Fathom Tether is a high quality tether cable designed specifically for ROVs and other subsea applications. 
It is neutrally buoyant, has 500+ lb breaking strength, and is embedded with water-blocking fibers to seal any leaks. The tether has a diameter of 7.6mm and is slimmer than the vast majority of comparable ROV tethers.

We put a lot of time into making sure that it has impeccable electrical qualities. The tether carries four unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) of 26AWG wire. 
These pairs are colored and arranged in the same fashion as a Cat5 networking cable including cross-talk resistance. Each pair is individually jacketed inside the cable to maintain reliable properties and minimize interference between each pair of wires.

# Installation

The _Fathom_ Tether can be installed into a watertight enclosure using the following procedure:

1. Wearing a protective glove, bend the cable at the point that you want to cut. Bending the cable makes it easy to see when you have cut through the jacket.



2. Using a knife, gently slice the jacket open using a sawing motion. Stop when the jacket opens and you can see the white Dacron fibers underneath the jacket.

3. Turn the tether open and repeat on the other side.

4. To remove the unneeded part of the jacket, lay the tether on a sturdy flat surface, then cut along the top of the part of the tether that you wish to remove. Take care not to cut deeper than the jacket.

5. Pull off the length of jacket that you just cut.

6. Unwind the clear plastic wrap and white fibers that are wound around the outside of the conductor bundle to the jacket.

7. Seperate out the white Dacron fibers from the conductor bundle.

8. Cut off the all white fibers and plastic wrap at the jacket.

9. Find a stranded pair and grab it near the end which has been cut.

10. Use a knife split the pair. You don't have to cut very far, then you can pull apart with your fingers or pliers.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-12.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px"  />
	
11. With the 26 AWG slot on a set of wire strippers, remove the insulation from each conductor.

12. Clean the jacket and the tether penetrator that will touch epoxy with isopropyl alcohol.
	
13. Twist the Kevlar and the conductors so that they will slide through the penetrator.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-14.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px"  />
	
14. Apply a small amount of super glue to the edge of the cable jacket. Optionally, you can apply "CA kicker" inside the penetrator so that the glue will dry quickly.

15. Insert the tether into the penetrator, allow time for the super glue to set.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-15.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px"  />
	
16. Mix a small batch of [Loctite Marine Epoxy](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/tools/loctite-marine-epoxy/) and fill a syring from the [potting kit.](https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/tools/tool-potting-kit-r1/)
	
17. Fill the penetrator hole with the epoxy. Move the cable from side to side within the hole to ensure the epoxy is filling all gaps. Use a vice or other secure method to hold the penetrator upright with the tether centered while the epoxy dries.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-16.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px"  />
	
18. When the epoxy has dried, apply epoxy to the other side of the penetrator using the same method.

	<img src="/fathom/cad/tether-tutorial-18.PNG" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px"  />
	
19. Cut off excess Kevlar strands, and that's it!
	
# Strain Relief

Please note that this tether is stiff enough to transfer enough torque to loosen a tether penetrator if connected directly to your underwater vessel.

We recommend the following method to relieve the strain on the tether penetrator:

1. Grab the tether somewhere between about 16 and 24 inches away from the penetrator and loop it around a plastic thimble.

2. Firmly attach three alternating heavy gauge zip ties at the base of the thimble.

3. Firmly attach the thimble to your vehicle using at least two heavy gauge zip ties.
