# Introduction

The **BlueROV** is an unassembled ROV kit with frame, watertight enclosure, thrusters, and speed controllers. Hardware/software experience required. It uses six thrusters to provide six-degree-of-freedom control allowing you to point the ROV in any orientation to film anything, grab anything with a simple robot arm, and have a lot of fun! 

## Safety 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with electricity, especially in water, always practice caution. Always ensure that connections are secure and watertight. Keep your body away from spinning motors and propellers.

# Assembly

## Installing the Battery Enclosure onto the Bottom Panel

1. Take one battery cradle and apply several drops of threadlocker to the bottom third of the screw holes on the bottom of the cradle.

5. Install the side panels to the bottom panel.

	<img src="cad/brov-assembly-step5-annotated.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />
	
6. Install the center panel assemblies to the side panels.

	<img src="cad/brov-assembly-step6-annotated.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />
	
Now your ROV should look like the picture below, and it is time to move on to setting up your electronics enclosure.

## Electronics Enclosure

The electronics enclosure ships partially assembled, and will arive looking like this.

<img src="cad/electronics-assembly-step0.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

1. Remove the tube from the rear flange. You can twist a screwdriver in the slots if it does not pull off easily.

	<img src="cad/electronics-assembly-step1.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />

2. Remove the rear 14 hole end cap by removing the screws using a M2.5 Allen key. Place the M3x12 screws and the clips in a safe place. 

	<img src="cad/electronics-assembly-step2-annotated.png" class="img-responsive" style="max-width:700px" />
	
3. Connect the ESC power wires to the power terminals

4. Connect the ESC motor wires to the motor wire terminals.

5. Attach your autopilot/computer.

6. 	Attach your tether board.

7. Attach the tether board power jumpers to the power terminal blocks and the tether board

7. Cut the 5V line on 5 of the ESC signal wires, then connect your ESC signal wires to your autopilot. 

8. Attach your camera wire to the tether board

9. Connect your camera servo signal wire to your autopilot

10. Apply silicone grease to nine 013 O-rings, then install them onto the 6 T200 penetrators, the Lumen Light penetrator, the Fathom Tether penetrator, and the power cable penetrator (side without bullet connectors), 
	
11. Install the T200 Thrusters, Lumen Lights, Fathom Tether, and power cable penetrators into the end cap as shown below, using two 16mm open end wrenches. 
You should tighten the penetrators finger tight plus ~1/16 of a turn. To make sure that the penetrators are tight enough, try to loosen them with your fingers after tightening. If you can't loosen them they are tight enough.

12. Reinstall the end cap onto the electronics enclosure, using the screws, clips, and M2.5 Allen key from step 2.

13. Connect the Bar30 signal wire to the I<sup>2</sup>C port on your autopilot.

14. Connect the power wires to the power terminal blocks.

15. Connect the Lumen light signal wire to your autopilot and the Lumen light power and ground wires to the power terminals.

15.  Connect your motor wires to the motor wire terminal
